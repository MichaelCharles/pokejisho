# PokéJisho

## Support Pokémon Sword and Shield! (Updated Feburary 25, 2020)

The translation data for this project was updated on February 25, 2020. PokéJisho should now support the majority of games up to and incuding Sword and Shield. I've come up with a way to update the data which I think will make it easier to keep PokéJisho up-to-date going forward.

## What is PokéJisho?

PokeJisho is a way to easily look up the names of Pokemon, items, moves, abilities, and natures in either English or Japanese to find what it is called in the other language. It also provides links to Bulbapedia and ポケモンwiki to allow you to easily look them up.
